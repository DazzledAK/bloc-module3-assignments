1. What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays? - The pros of using linked lists instead of an array is that you can store much more in a linked list than an array, linked lists can also be stored anywhere there is avaliable memory location unlike arrays which have to be in like a line. The con for linked list are that it's much harder to find exactly what your looking for in a linked list than in an array as you can't index.

2. Come up with a real world example of a linked list. - A linked list is like a scavenger hunt because you have to find a clue to point to another clue till you keep going till the end.

Programming Questions

1. The Linked List push function should take a value, create a node, and add it to the end of a list. Below is a push function for a singly linked list. However, there is something wrong with it. Find the bug and fix the code.

First you would create a push function and then you would create the node variable with properties after that you would create an if else statement and change node to head if it's not existing.

LinkedList.prototype.push = function(element) {
 SET node = {
   value: element,
   next: null
 }

 IF the head node does exist (took out the not)
   THEN SET head to node
 ELSE
   SET current node to head
   SET current.next to node
 }
}

2. Given an unsorted singly linked list, remove all duplicates from the linked list.

Well this turned out to be really hard! I have asked on slack but didn't get too much help and it's takes around 30 minutes sometimes or more to get an answer. I just found out how to create a LinkedList which wasn't that hard but kind of confusing for a first timer. I couldn't for my life find out how to remove duplicates like I have search so much of google for some help and just couldn't for javascript and the ones that did have something were really confusing and sometimes didn't work. I would really like some help with this. I will redo this but for now just submitted it so that I can later come back because I have been trying since morning.

This is my code for my List: 

function LinkedList() {
  var length = 0;
  var head = null;

  var Node = function(element) {
    this.element = element;
    this.next = null;
  }

  this.size = function() {
    return length;
  }

  this.head = function() {
    return head;
  }

  this.add = function(element) {
    var node = new Node(element);
    if(head === null) {
      head = node;
    } else {
      var currentNode = head;

      while(currentNode.next) {
        currentNode = currentNode.next;
      }
      currentNode.next = node;
    }
    length++;
  };
}

var list = new LinkedList();
list.add("Kitten")
list.add("Dog")

Not sure how to do number 2-3 but I will keep trying! Hardest checkpoint I've had so far in all the modules.
